# NeuroBotX

This repository is an App for Slack intended to be hosted on [Beep Boop][bb].  It's written in [node.js](), uses the [Slapp][slapp] library, and takes advantage of the [Slack Events API][slack-events-api].

## Setup Instructions

Once you've created a new [Beep Boop](bb) project with this repo, go to your project's **Settings** tab and enable a Slack App.

Follow the steps laid out in the wizard. You'll want to enable **Event Subscriptions** on your Slack App using the `URL` provided and add subscriptions for the following **Bot Events**:

+ `im_open`
+ `im_close`
+ `message.channels`
+ `message.im`
+ `team_join`

### ðŸ”¥ it up

Once you've finished setting up your Slack App and saved the `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Verification Token` on Beep Boop, go ahead and **Start** your project.
